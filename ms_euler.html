		Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)
		</h1>
		<p>
		The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
	<strong> Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
	he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
	Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
	and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
	Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
	publishing over <em>800 different books</em> and papers. His 
	influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
		</p>
		<p>
		He is perhaps best known for his research into 
	mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
	<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, 
	remained a standard textbook in the field for 
	well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
	he wrote 
	<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
	giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
	physical theories of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
		One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
	copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
	as <var>e</var> and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
	in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
	leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
	certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
